<p>I am an experienced end-to-end developer in the Austin area. My recent development projects include creating the iOS interactive story application "Deep Dream" as well as designing, building, and launching websites for various individuals and organizations. In Spring 2016 I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's Degree in Government and I currently serve as a Project Manager in the Rate Analysis Department of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Previous political organizations I have worked for include The Brookings Institution, Project Vote Smart, the political news television program <i>Capital Tonight</i> of Spectrum News, and the political campaign of then Texas Agriculture Commissioner for the 2014 Texas Lieutenant Governor's Election.</p>
